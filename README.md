# Detection of topographic highs

Matlab Code: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/61540-detection-of-topographic-highs

This code is an implementation of VOLEI method based on the paper [1].
In this work, an unsupervised isocontour based segmentation method is proposed, that is applied on the
detection of topographic highs with arbitrary basal shapes on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
We will appreciate if you cite our paper [1] in your work:
